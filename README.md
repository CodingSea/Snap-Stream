## Wins and Blockers

**Wins include:**

* I managed to upload images and videos to Cloudinary and utilised queries to get the necessary data from the database.

**Blockers include:**

## Additional features

* Dark Theme
* Profile Description
* Upload multiple images or videos to a single post.
* Mobile Support

## In Conclusion
